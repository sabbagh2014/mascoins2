      "You donâ€™t. That is the fun part. Only after the initial reveal phase is over or the sale concludes (Whichever is earlier), the artwork is assigned to your NFT. This is done by an on-chain random mechanism. The sale is purposely hidden in order to avoid the founders or anyone else to buy the rarest NFTs themselves. There is an initial sequence in which each NFT is hashed for the proof of the full collection. The actual sequence is determined after the initial sale period through a randomized starting index. So if the starting index is 5000, #0 Hashmask would get the image of the 5000th from the initial sequence. The random starting index is determined by either the first mint transaction after the reveal period or the mint transaction of the last NFT, i.e Hashmask #16383 (whichever is earlier).",

    head: "Price Slip: What if i mint Hashmasks just before the price tier ends?",
    summary:
      "If you mint more than one Hashmask near the end of price tier, there's a chance of price slip. So for example, let's say the current supply is 2999 (1 left for price change from 0.1 to 0.3), if you mint 10 masks at this point, you would be able to get all of them for the old price of 0.1. We purposely designed it this way for simplicity and avoiding too many reverted transactions at the end of each price tier.",

In order to be able to name your Hashmask John, you would need to purchase the current John from his owner, change the name of the current John to Simon and then you could name some other Hashmask John. But beware, if someone sees this transaction, they can frontrun you and get the name before you.",
